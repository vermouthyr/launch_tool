`launch_tool` is a tiny tool for launching a flask service when you don't have some private access right.

1. Ask those who have access right to run the `launch_server.py`.
2. Run `launch_client.py` on your machine.
3. Send the code you predefined.
4. When you want to re-launch the service, just visit the `ip:port/shutdown` to stop flask service. Then send the code again.
